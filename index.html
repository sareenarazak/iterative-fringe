            <h2>Community Agreement</h2>
            <h4> General </h4>
            <p>
                We follow the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/">Contributor
                    Covenant</a> and the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">Recurse
                    Center</a> social rules. It is likely that we will modify the Contributor Covenant slightly in
                the future to suit our particular needs, by consensus.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, we strive for moderation to be done in a peer-to-peer way. If someone's behaviour makes
                you uncomfortable, bring it up directly with them, or find a third party you trust to relay the
                message and/or mediate. If you receive feedback about your behaviour, stop and reflect on it, and
                take it to
                heart. If you cannot productively engage with someone, don't engage with them. If someone asks you
                not to engage with them, respect that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some spaces (Zulip channels/topics/etc) have social norms that are different from the broader
                social norms of the space. For example, in channels where topics are strongly associated with a
                particular
                person (e.g. #consciousness, channels where each topic is for a specific person's project, etc),
                that
                person can set what subjects are and are not allowed in that topic (within the existing rules
                set by
                the
                Contributor Covenant). Some channels may be for discussion of a particular topic where some
                ideological
                agreement is assumed — for example, a #veganism channel is not a place to argue about animal
                agriculture
                being good for the environment, and a #unions channel is not a place for arguing about
                "right-to-work"
                laws being good.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not share non-harassing messages that people wrote in the community more widely than the
                initial audience that message had without the explicit consent of the person who wrote the
                message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our agreements can and should be modified by consensus among the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not
                let these rules get in the way of caring for each other and the community.
            </p>
            <h4>Handling Conflict</h4>
            <p>As a general rule, conflict should be handled in a peer-to-peer way, as noted above. This means being
                direct about your boundaries, proactively stepping up when you see misunderstandings or frustrations
                developing between members of the community, and seeking out mediation when needed. While we hope that
                most disputes can be resolved through this process, it is important to have something to fall back on in
                cases where such a system does not work, especially in cases of abuse or harassment. In order to handle
                these cases, we will have a “mediation committee” which is responsible for helping to resolve conflict
                which was not successfully resolved via other means, and which has the power to, by consensus among the
                active committee members, remove people from the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main role of the mediation committee is to be a resource for members who want assistance in
                resolving conflicts. When approached by community members who are involved in a conflict, the active
                committee members will talk to the people involved, try to help the community members talk with each
                other, and attempt to come up with a resolution that all parties can agree to. If no such agreement can
                be reached, the moderation committee has the option of, by consensus among the active committee members,
                removing people from the community, either temporarily or indefinitely. Should anyone be removed from
                the community, the mediation committee will provide a explanation to the community of who was removed
                and why (while being mindful of any relevant privacy concerns), and, in cases where it is reasonable to
                do so, will allow the person being removed from the community to post a goodbye message/download a
                archive of their messages/etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who is interested in becoming a member of the mediation committee can express interest. Members
                of the community will have two weeks (likelty to be increased in the future) to comment with any
                concerns they may have. If no concerns have been raised in two weeks, or if
                all concerns raised have been addressed, the volunteer will be added to the mediation committee.
                Existing mediation committee members may be removed by the consensus of all other mediation committee
                members.
